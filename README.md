# Python-Challenge
In this challenge, I wrote two python scripts to analyze budget and poll data in the files provided in the Resources folder. For the budget data, the Financial analysis shows the Total Months, Total Profit, Average Change, Greatest Increae and Decrease along with the dates associated. The Poll data results show the candidates and their total votes, percentage votes as well as the winner of the election. I struggled with the output of the dictionaries in the Poll analysis. I wasn't able to print the values side by side for the matching keys as they are shown in the instructions since my values are housed in separate dictionaries. Any tips on how to improve this code are appreciated!
